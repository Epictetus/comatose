I forgot to mention, I made back from my vacation and seemingly requisite post-vacation sickness. For all you guys who kept an eye on the forums whilst I was away: Thanks! I really appreciate it.

I mentioned somewhere that there might be an asset manager in the next version of Comatose. While I did look into it, and had it mostly working, I've reconsidered. I think that an asset manager might make a good plugin of it's own, but it's probably too much for Comatose. It wouldn't feel quite so 'Micro'.

Revisions, however, are definitely on the list for version 0.7!
