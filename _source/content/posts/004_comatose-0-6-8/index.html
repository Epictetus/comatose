There's been a few more updates I thought I'd summarize:

*version: 0.6.8*

* @ComatoseController@ now references @plugin_layout_path@ correctly
* HTML/CSS/JS cleanup on the administration view -- it now works with or without JavaScript

*version: 0.6.7*

* Removed @Comatose::Page.record_timestamps = false@ -- it was breaking the magic. Override the @record_timestamp@ methods instead
* @AdminController@ was still referencing, in a few places, @ComatoseController@ for page cache expiration 

*version: 0.6.6*

* The cache expiration code is now on the @ComatoseAdminController@, as it should have been in the first place
* Changed internal references from @root_paths@ or @cms_root@ to @mount_point@, since that's what I've started calling them... And it seems to make the most sense
* Cleaned up the @class_options@ code
* Added initial support for pre-caching pages (generating static HTML), there's not a UI element for it yet, however, nor does it really work right
* Changes to content-type handling:
** Removed @Comatose::Options.force_utf8@
** Added support for @Comatose::Options.content_type = "utf-8"@ This will affect the HTTP headers, as well as the META tag in the admin views
* Changed this log file to yaml format. And yes, there's a method to my madness... Wait for it.
