There have been a noted lack of updates around here lately... Sorry about that. It's partially because I've been pretty busy, and partially because the tool I was using to maintain this site was rather cumbersome.

There have been a noted lack of updates around here lately... Sorry about that. It's partially because I've been pretty busy, and partially because the tool I was using to maintain this site was rather cumbersome.

So, here's the new -- and easier to update -- development site!

In the next few days I'll be posting an update on version 0.8, and talk about where Comatose is heading from here. Stay tuned!
