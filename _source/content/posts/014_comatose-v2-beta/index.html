Wow. It's been a really long time since I've updated the dev site, eh? Well, Comatose isn't dead. It's just been sleeping. Deeply. :-)

Wow. It's been a really long time since I've updated the dev site, eh? Well, Comatose isn't dead. It's just been sleeping. Deeply. :-) 

Seriously though, a while ago I quietly started working on [Comatose 2][]. It's Rails 2 compatible. In fact, there is a beta version on [GitHub][] right now. [Check it out][].

#### From the Changelog

- version: 2.0.3 (beta)
    - Moving from alpha to beta!
    - [staugaard][]: Added import and export of pages in admin controller

- version: 2.0.2 (alpha)
    - [staugaard][]: Added "unloadable" to `ComatoseController` (problems with `ActsAsAuthenticated`-integration similar to [http://tinyurl.com/6caz5r][])
    - [jcnetdev][]: Tweaking gemspec

- version: 2.0.1 (alpha)
    - Merged changes from andreas...
    - [andreas][]: Fixed `comatose:admin:customize` rake task (seems `plugin_path` was wrong, and made use of `mkdir_p` to avoid "File exists"-errors.) 
    - [andreas][]: Added "unloadable" to `ComatoseAdminController` (problems with `ActsAsAuthenticated`-integration similar to [http://tinyurl.com/6caz5r][])

- version: 2.0 (uber alpha)
    - Removed controllers, models, and helpers from `Comatose` module. It was causing odd issues
    - Initial support for Rails 2.1(ish)
    - Fixed up slug generation to remove leading and trailing whitespace
    - Moved to github
    - Changed all the `.rhtml` files to `.html.erb`
    - Adding support for use as a gem plugin

#### Some Thanks Yous

You may notice from the Changelog that there have been some patches from other githubbers... Thanks [andreas][], [jcnetdev][], and [staugaard][]! Hopefully this will be the start of a trend. :-)

Also, thank you very much to those of you who have donated monetarily to Comatose! It's very much appreciated, and it's encouraged me to get back and update Comatose.

Oh, as long as I'm on the topic of 'Thanks yous'. I'm not sure if I ever mentioned this, but the fun 'Comatose' logo at the top of the page here was contributed by [Desbytree][]. Thanks!

#### Coming Up/Ideas

I have a few ideas for where I'd like to take Comatose next, here's a high-level overview.

* Improvements in the `ComatoseAdminController` to reduce number of DB calls for building the page tree.
* Remove dependency on `acts_as_list` and `acts_as_tree`.
* A script to automatically create rails test harnesses.
* UI refresh (nothing major, just some cleanup).
* RESTful goodness.
* Support XML/JSON responses from `ComatoseController` and `ComatoseAdminController`.
* Support for static rendering (for *generating* sites like this blog).

If you find any bugs, feel free to [report them][] -- or -- just fork your own version of Comatose and start hacking!

Have anything to add? You can email me at `matt at elucidata dot net`.
