Version 0.6.5 is another maintenance release. I haven't created a post for each update, but here's summary of the updates since 0.6:

* Fixed a bug in @comatose_admin.js@ -- if you hid any of the @meta_fields@ it would barf
* Fixed a typo in @comatose_admin_customize.rhtml@
* Controller now keeps all information about mount points not just the @:root@ (uri) and @:index@ (page tree)
* Fixed the customization tasks
